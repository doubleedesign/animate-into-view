# Basic usage: CSS classes

Get up and running quickly by linking the provided CSS and adding classes the HTML elements you wish to animate in.

This method uses the default `threshold` of 0.75, meaning the animation will be triggered when 75% of the element is visible in the viewport.

1. Add the CSS and JS to your page.
```html
<link href="path/to/animate-into-view.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
<script src="path/to/animate-into-view.js" type="module"></script>
```
2. Add `animate-into-view` and `aiv-` classes to the element(s) you want to animate in.
```html
<section class="animate-into-view aiv-fadeIn">
    <p>Some content</p>
</section>
```

You can adjust the duration of the animation by overriding the `animation-duration` property in `.animate-into-view` in your own CSS.

### Add your own animations
Add your own animations in your CSS by creating the relevant animation and `aiv-` class. Below is an example of how `fadeIn` works:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
    }
}

.animate-into-view.aiv-visible.aiv-fadeIn {
    animation-name: fadeIn;
}
```
Essential styles are applied to `.animate-into-view` and `.aiv-visible` (the latter is added by the JavaScript), so you must still add the `animate-into-view` class to the element for your custom animation to work.

### Override animation settings
You can also add overrides in your CSS, for example to change the animation duration or add a delay:
```css
/** Globally **/
.animate-into-view {
    animation-duration: 1s; /* Default is 1s*/
    animation-delay: 0.3s; /* No delay by default, add yours here if desired */
}

/** To a specific-element **/
.foo {
    animation-duration: 1s; /* Default is 1s*/
    animation-delay: 0.3s; /* No delay by default, add yours here if desired */
}
```
