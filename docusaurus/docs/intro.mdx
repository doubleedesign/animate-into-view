# Introduction

Animate-Into-View uses JavaScript [Intersection Observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver) to detect when an element (or set amount of an element) is visible in the viewport and adds the `aiv-visible` class, which is in turn used to apply CSS animations to the element.

The currently available animations fall into two broad categories:
- **Fade-ins**: Animates opacity from 0 to 1, and position for all except `fadeIn` (e.g., `fadeInLeft` has the element start off to the left of its final position).
- **Slide-ins**: Animates position only.

Available animations are `fadeIn`, `fadeInUp`, `fadeInDown`, `fadeInLeft`, `fadeInRight`, `slideInUp`, `slideInDown`, `slideInLeft`, `slideInRight`.
