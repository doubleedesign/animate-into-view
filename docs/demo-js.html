        <h2>They don’t know that we know they know we know.</h2>
        <p>You can't just give up. Is that what a dinosaur would do? I just stopped and I said, what if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a
            purse, you know, or a hat? Santa, the armadillo and I will have a little talk in the kitchen. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. What
            was I thinking at dinner? "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!</p>
        <p>That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds. I wanna quit the gym! You know what I figure? If I can do laundry, there's nothing I can’t do. I
            understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral? They don’t know that we know they know we know. Welcome to
            the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it! I'm a gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last twelve hundred times.</p>
        <p>We were on a break! They're as different as night and...later that night. Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I BE wearing any more clothes? You have really
            great hair. Oh thanks, I grow it myself. </p>

        <h2>We ordered the Joey Special. Three pizzas!</h2>
        <p>What if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love? I mean, wouldn't that be a great
            story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. So it seems like this internet thing is here to stay. That's a lot of information to get in 30
            seconds I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. And what's the opposite of man? Jam. What was I thinking at dinner? "Do you want soup or salad?"
            Both! Always order both! </p>
        <p>They're as different as night and...later that night. You see, my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts an extra
            slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. I wanna quit the gym! Oh God. Can open. Worms everywhere! What's the
            difference between beer and lager? I don't know. We could look it up. Things are about to get wild. Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat
            everything. Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I BE wearing any more clothes? There's an old Russian expression...Roughly translated, it means: "This
            thing that I'm looking at: Wow." </p>
        <p>We might still have some money if your father hadn't thought it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet. It's a moo point. It’s like a cow's opinion; it doesn't matter. It's moo. I'm Chandler. I make jokes when I’m
            uncomfortable. You have to stop the Q-Tip when there’s resistance!</p>
