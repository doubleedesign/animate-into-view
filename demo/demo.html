            <p>So it seems like this internet thing is here to stay. I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
                I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. And what's the opposite of man? Jam.</p>

        <p>You can't just give up. Is that what a dinosaur would do? I just stopped and I said, what if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a
            purse, you know, or a hat? Santa, the armadillo and I will have a little talk in the kitchen. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. What
            was I thinking at dinner? "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!</p>
        <p>That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds. I wanna quit the gym! You know what I figure? If I can do laundry, there's nothing I can’t do. I
            understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral? They don’t know that we know they know we know. Welcome to
            the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it! I'm a gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last twelve hundred times.</p>
        <p>We were on a break! They're as different as night and...later that night. Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I BE wearing any more clothes? You have really
            great hair. Oh thanks, I grow it myself. </p>

            <p>Joey doesn't share food! Three bathrooms in this place, and I threw up in a coat closet. Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything. Come
                on, Ross, you're a paleontologist. Dig a little deeper.</p>
